Pseudocode to C++ Code – Building a Transformer Model from Scratch

Converting pseudocode into executable C++ code is far from trivial. It requires understanding both natural language and programming syntax. In my latest project, I built a Transformer-based sequence-to-sequence model from scratch to tackle this problem.

Using the SPoC dataset, I trained a model that learns from paired pseudocode and C++ examples. Instead of relying on pretrained models, I implemented a custom Transformer with embeddings, positional encodings, and an encoder-decoder architecture—all in PyTorch.

Key Highlights:

Custom tokenizer and vocabulary designed for code structure.
Efficient training and checkpointing, with a dynamic progress bar in Streamlit.
Deployment on Hugging Face Spaces, allowing users to input pseudocode and get C++ output instantly.
Building this model reinforced the complexity of code translation, from handling unique formatting to optimizing sequence generation. This project is a step toward bridging natural language and programming with deep learning.
